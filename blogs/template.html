<blockquote>
<p>In man&rsquo;s life, his time is a mere instant, his existence a flux, his perception fogged, his whole bodily composition rotting, his mind a whirlgig, his fortune unpredictable, his fame unclear. To put it shortly: all things of the body stream away like a river, all things of the mind are dreams and delusion; life is warfare, and a visit to a strange land; the only lasting fame is oblivion. <br>
<strong>~Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</strong></p>

<h1 id="mission">Mission:</h1>
<ol>
<li>To deliver knowledge including but not limited to the philosophy of Stoicism.</li>
<li>To provide practical and actionable tools and processes that enable the application of said knowledge.</li>
<li>To instill a dedication to the four Stoic Virtues of Wisdom, Courage, Temperance, and Justice.</li>
<li>To teach the skills required that strengthen one to be sober, and strongly tethered to reality</li>
<li>To enable the creation-from-scratch of an internal framework of thought and morality based on observable, material reality.</li>
<li>To enable one to:
<ul>
<li>never be weak, dependent, servile, or slavish</li>
<li>never be hampered or be forced to do anything against one&rsquo;s will, and finally,</li>
<li>never blame, accuse, or hold resentment against another</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Through point 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, to prepare one to navigate all the existential questions, gray areas, difficulties, and surprises that life can (and will) present.</li>
<li>Through all of the above, allow one to lead a socially, emotionally, intellectually, and politically a well-rounded and fulfilling life.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="core-values">Core Values:</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wisdom:</strong> The ability to discern right from wrong, and good from bad, and navigate through well through all the gray areas of life.</li>
<li><strong>Courage:</strong> The virtue that sustains all others and allows one to face life, death, success, failure, and misfortune alike.</li>
<li><strong>Temperance:</strong> Moderation in everything.</li>
<li><strong>Justice:</strong> An internal drive to do the right thing. (After all, how impressive is courage if itâ€™s only about self-interest? ~Marcus Aurelius)</li>
<li><strong>Humility:</strong> I am nobody, and I know nothing. I am plagued with doubts. I am willing to learn from everything.</li>
<li><strong>Sobreity:</strong> The strength to face life sober with no escapist behaviours (including distraction, excessive use of social media, substance-dependence etc)</li>
<li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Never give up, never give in. Do not be discouraged by failure or setbacks.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> Radical acceptance of reality.</li>
<li><strong>Ahimsa &amp; Non-Violence:</strong> Living in accordance with the principle of Ahimsa and Universally Prefferable Behaviour.</li>
<li><strong>Freedom:</strong> To strive towards being fully self-sufficient and independent.</li>
<li><strong>Contentment:</strong> Gratefullness towards everything, and a silent awareness that life can always be worse, and that one is not entiled to anything, not even life itself.</li>
<li><strong>Minimalism:</strong> Simplicity and Minimalism in food, thought, and lifestyle.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership:</strong> A striving to lead by example and inspire change rather than trying to force change onto others.</li>
<li><strong>Action-Orientedness:</strong> Action, Action, Action. Less thoughts, more action.</li>
<li><strong>Inquisitiveness:</strong> Question everything.</li>
