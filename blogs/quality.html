<h1>Why I Really Really Really Love VIM!</h1>
</header>
<article>
<p>I have been using vi editor for the last half-decade. But it was when I feel lazy to copy files from the servers to local and edit them. I was aware of vim but never bothered to use it.
Spending money means saving money,

Utility + Satisfaction

Cost per wear

Materials to avoid
not knocking

I militantly rek

preventable evils
deeply rooted misconception

at each stage, there is room for scrutiny whether they be real or imaginary
ficticious
</p>


<p>A couple of months back, I decided to try out vim more often. Today, my default text editor is neovim. Sometimes, when I try to use sublime text or other plain text editors, my finger will behave like hjkl escape.    </p>

<p>Nowadays, most of the time I spent now is on the terminal. This note contains a quick cheat sheet for the things I pick up now and then.     </p>

<h2>Basic commands in VIM</h2>

<p>Modes of vim:</p>

<pre><code>normal mode - escape key will bring you to normal mode.
insert mode - i, a, s, o, or similar to get into insert mode.
visual mode - v visual, shift+v visual-line, cntr+v visual block.
command mode - : or / will show command at bottom of the vim screen.
replace mode - r, R its just an extension of insert mode.
</code></pre>

<p>Navigation in vim:</p>

<pre><code>h - left shift
j - bottom shift

gg - go to the top

0 - Go to the beginning of the line

[0-9] + any of the above commands will multiply the commands
</code></pre>

<p>Operation in vim:</p>

<pre><code>i - Insert at the current position

<p>Yank and Visual operation:</p>

<pre><code>y - Yank from the current position
yy/Y - Yank current line
v - visual selection current pos
V - visual select line
ctrl+v - Visual block
</code></pre>

<p>Commandline mode in vim:</p>

<pre><code>:set number - shows the number
:q - quit
:w - write
:help - show all manual for command
</code></pre>

<p>Above commands were just basic vim commands. But the power of vim relies on how you combine it to get proper results. Below are few examples:</p>

<pre><code>dfi - Delete all till next occurrence of i

dis - Delete statement

yt} - Yank before }

<p>If I add all possible combinations, this note will never end. At end of this note, there are few Q&amp;A which will contain some more commands combination.   </p>

<h2>Registers, Macros, Bookmark, Buffers in VIM</h2>

<h3>Bookmark</h3>

<pre><code>ma - Bookmark will be created with the name a.
`a - Move to bookmark 'a' location.
'a - Move to start of bookmark.
:marks - List all bookmarks
:delmarks a - delete bookmark a
</code></pre>

<h3>Macros: Vim macros is a extremely powerful tool. Its based on 4 stages.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Start recording: q followed by any lowercase letter.</li>
<li>Enter your vim actions</li>
<li>Stop recording: Enter q</li>
<li>Play recording: Enter @lowercase letter    </li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>qa - start recording macro named 'a'
"a   INOTE : ^[j - vim action
10@a - Macro run 10 times.
:reg - check all macros
</code></pre>

<h3>Registers</h3>

<p>Named registers: We can use 26 named registers; we can use a-z or A-Z. By default vim doesnâ€™t uses these registers.    </p>

<p>Numbered registers: We can use 0 to 9 named registers. Vim fills these registers with text from yank and delete command.    </p>

<pre><code>"aY - yank current line in register a
"ap - Paste from register a
" - Default registers used for yank/dd
</code></pre>

<pre><code>:buffers/:ls - List all buffers
:badd &lt;file&gt; - Add file into new buffer

:bp - Move to the previous buffer in buffer list
:bf - Move to the first buffer
:ball - Load all buffers
:bufdo set nu - line numbers enabled for all buf
:bufdo %s/#/@/g | w - global substitute from # to g
shift+w - To move from different windows
:wall - write to all
:bd - delete current buffer
</code></pre>

<h3>Tab and Windows</h3>

<pre><code>:vs - vertical split

:vs file - open file in vertical split
:tabnew - Add new tab
:tabclose - tab close
