<h3>Why this is dumb</h3>
<p>
Reading this comment without any prior knowledge on fabric properties or garment construction can easily lead you into the trap of thinking, I'm not rich so automatically quality (fabrics/construction) doesn't really matter to me - but my tailor can make me look like the real deal.
Yeah, that's true to an extent a skilled alterations tailor will have no problem making you look good in a poorly made suit but all this mentality does is get you to waste your money. This article is going to break down, why thinking this way is a HUGE financial opportunity cost and why this makes no sense.
<br>
Maybe, this is what the commenter what's you to think. Yeah, that's true and all, a good alterations tailor can help you look good in a Â£100 suit but will you feel good?
</p>
<h3>The weirdest thing!</h3>

<p>"Between a bespoke 3 grand suit...<br>

<p>
The weirdest thing is that bespoke, depending on: your income, who/where is your tailor and the fabrics you choose can be quite affordable.
A bespoke suit from Hong Kong can roughly be equal to a 'nicely fitted Boss suit'.

I've seen tailors based in England charge under a grand for a fully canvassed suit (handmade in Great Britain of course). Sure, there are suitmakers in Saville Row who charge 3 grand for a two-piece but I can understand that. You have a high rent for the premises, staff (apprentices in the trade and skilled people) all working under you. What I don't understand is where being 'rich' comes into this.
Literally anyone, unless you're in the minority of people who can't feel heat or sensations, can tell the difference between a pure wool suit or plastic-polyester suit in the summer.

If you live in a city and think that is expensive, add up all the times you've bought a cup of coffee in the last year

<h3>Hate exploitation</h3>
<p>j
Do  you believe mass-manufacturing enables exploitation, then I have good news for you. Learning tailoring or going bespoke eliminates most of that
</p>
<h3>Love the environment</h3>
<p>
I don't think anyone want's to be a part of the throw-away economy but what you're unconsciously committing to by having this mentality is precisely that.
</p>
But what OP is fundementally saying is that
When you first read this comment without prerequisite knowledge on
fabrics/construction/differences between handmade/massmanufacturing it's easy to fall into the trap. That as long as it looks good, on the outside what's on the inside doesn't matter.


When I first saw this comment, I really had to overthink my entire view on bespoke.
I mean what if whoever commented this was right and the centuries long practice of
bespoke lost all it's integrity - becoming a mere hype... No not really.
    On the surface, what OP is saying isn't too farfetched.
    And on the "surface" OP's tailor can just as well make it look like the real deal.
    But assuming, he has not bought a vintage/bespoke suit for 100 pound but an off
    the peg suit. well
    Tailor
    Then I closed my eyes and laughed at how this

You have to survive holding your breath from one hipster downtown area to the next.
This is a multifaceted mistake.
</p>

<p>
What is bespoke?
</p>
<p>
If there is any hype, it is purely a very small and very modern phenomenon.
Interestingly enough before mass manufacturing, off-the-peg wasn't nearly
as commonplace as today. A man walked into a shop, expected to have his measurements taken and sent to the factory and a few weeks later had his first fitting for the garment he ordered. The factory would cut and assemble the garment, using a proper canvas (fusible interlining wasn't invented until 1969!) and mainly from all natural materials. Not exactly bespoke but the principle stands. Those garments would fetch 200-300 pounds now. More hype, more competition lower prices...

<p>
The other day I saw a bespoke suit sell for under 25 pound online,
full floating canvas, with a lovely flannel
</p>
Mass-manufacturing with
assembly lines and rows upon rows of machinery wasn't so commonplace in the past... A man walked into a shop, expecting to have his measurements taken and sent of to a factory. Which would cut and assemble the garment together, mainly by hand and with canvas (fusible interlining wasn't invented until) and natural materials!
All this being said, a bespoke garment is more long-lasting
</p>

<p>
"Only those who really know their suits and fabric" *cough *cough - "the rich".
It's probably possible to pinpoint OP's entire world-view on this statement alone but I'll break down the layers of cringe.
</p>

Bespoke attracts three sorts of people.
The person with an unusual body.
The person who is attracted to quality, craftsmanship and tradition.

In the past, off-the-peg wasn't a thing. You went in to get measured in which after
an assistant would send of said measurements to the factory.

If there is a hype in the 'bespoke industry'

Spending money means saving money,

Utility + Satisfaction

Cost per wear

Materials to avoid
not knocking

I militantly rek

preventable evils
deeply rooted misconception

at each stage, there is room for scrutiny whether they be real or imaginary
ficticious
</p>

<ul>
  <li>High armhole - Arm acts independently, greater range of motion </li>
  <li>Low armhole - Jacket lifts when you move, unpractical when reaching, restricts movement</li>
  <li>[1-9] + common natural materials</li>
</ul>




<h2>You want to know the real flex?</h2>
The real flex is having something hand-made. The real flex is pointing to a
fabric swatch and saying to your tailor, I want a coat made from that.

Hype tends to follow fast fashion, adapting towards the monsoon cycle and summer seasons, sticking
around till winter... before the whole design board has to create something new and heaps of unsold or unwanted clothes pile up in department stores, "falling" out of season, "falling" out of fashion.
