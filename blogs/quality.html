UNFINISHED
This is a multifaceted mistake.

If there is any hype, it is purely a very small and very modern phenomenon.
Interestingly enough before mass manufacturing, off-the-peg wasn't nearly
as commonplace as today. A man walked into a shop, expected to have his measurements taken and sent to the factory and a few weeks later had his first fitting for the garment he ordered. The factory would cut and assemble the garment, using a proper canvas (fusible interlining wasn't invented until 1969!) and mainly from all natural materials. Not exactly bespoke but the principle stands. Those garments would fetch 200-300 pounds now. More hype, more competition lower prices...


Mass-manufacturing with
assembly lines and rows upon rows of machinery wasn't so commonplace in the past... A man walked into a shop, expecting to have his measurements taken and sent of to a factory. Which would cut and assemble the garment together, mainly by hand and with canvas (fusible interlining wasn't invented until) and natural materials!
All this being said, a bespoke garment is more long-lasting

"Only those who really know their suits and fabric" *cough *cough - "the rich".
It's probably possible to pinpoint OP's entire world-view on this statement alone but I'll break down the layers of cringe.
</p>

Bespoke attracts three sorts of people.
The person with an unusual body.
The person who is attracted to quality, craftsmanship and tradition.

In the past, off-the-peg wasn't a thing. You went in to get measured in which after
an assistant would send of said measurements to the factory.

If there is a hype in the 'bespoke industry'

Spending money means saving money,

Utility + Satisfaction

Cost per wear

Materials to avoid
not knocking

I militantly rek

preventable evils
deeply rooted misconception

at each stage, there is room for scrutiny whether they be real or imaginary
ficticious
</p>

<ul>
  <li>High armhole - Arm acts independently, greater range of motion </li>
  <li>Low armhole - Jacket lifts when you move, unpractical when reaching, restricts movement</li>
  <li>[1-9] + common natural materials</li>
</ul>




<h2>You want to know the real flex?</h2>
The real flex is having something hand-made. The real flex is pointing to a
fabric swatch and saying to your tailor, I want a coat made from that.

Hype tends to follow fast fashion, adapting towards the monsoon cycle and summer seasons, sticking
around till winter... before the whole design board has to create something new and heaps of unsold or unwanted clothes pile up in department stores, "falling" out of season, "falling" out of fashion.
