<h2>Heads-up</h2>
<p>
If you're cash-short but time-plenty, learning to repair and resell
x220's can be a perfect opportunity for you to make some cash. This page won't contain any actual instructions in repairing.
<br><br>
Most "faulty" x220's I've seen are usually missing a drive or even the RAM. It's usually old people who are willing to let these laptops go for practically nothing.
</p>
<br>
<h2>How will this help others</h2>
I can't say for everyone but most sellers on eBay aren't cleaning out
the fans or applying fresh thermal paste on every laptop they sell. So while you can be scoring an absolute deal, if you don't understand computer thermals very well, you might be confused when it heats up and the fans sound like jets.
